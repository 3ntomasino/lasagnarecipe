This recipe drove my tastebuds wild as a child. Everyone has that comfort food that just feels like "home," and this is just that for me. Just remember to bring along a couple of buddies to share this beautiful slop with!

### Ingredients
* 9-11 Cooked Lasagna Noodles
* 1 lb of hamburger meat (browned)
* 1 1/4 oz package of spaghetti sauce mix
* 6 oz can of tomato paste
* 6 oz of water
* 24 oz of cottage cheese
* 1 lb of shredded mozzarella cheese
* 1 tablespoon of dried parsley


### Directions
1. Cook your noodles!
2. Brown that sweet hamburger meat. Be careful not to dry it out!
3. Add spaghetti mix, tomato paste, and the water to your hamburger meat, making sure to mix well and simmer together for <em>15 minutes</em>.
4. While simmering sauce, mix cottage cheese, mozzarella and parsley all together.
5. Start layering in a baking dish (9"x13" is a perfect size) - first sauce, then noodes, then cheese, until it's as you desire. I would recommend just until the top edge of the pan, but hey, who am I to judge you?
6. Sprinkle that sweet goodness with parmesan cheese to top it all off!
7. Bake for around <em>30 minutes</em>
8. Pull out of the oven and let it sit for about 10-15 minutes before serving. You sometimes get a crispier top if you cover the dish with tinfoil during this step.
9. Bust out your favorite bottle of wine and invite your friends around to feast!
